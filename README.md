# ubc-biol548o-w2020

BIOL 548O is a short module designed to help students work with datasets more effectively and efficiently. 


## Instructor

Dr. Matthew Pennell
Assstant Professor, Department of Zoology
Email: pennell@zoology.ubc.ca
Office hours: By appointment


## Logistics

The module will run from *February 4th* to *March 5th* (2020). Note that this differs slightly from the dates in the UBC Course calendar.

Classes will be in Biosciences 4223 on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1500-1630.


## Grades

### Grade breakdown

80% Homework assignments
20% In-class participation

### A note on grading philosophy
This module is focused on skill development. I recognize that different students will be coming from very different academic backgrounds have various levels of experience with the tools we are working with. And that's great -- we are all here to learn! As such, assessment for this module will be primary about the process (are you putting effort into developing your skillset?) and not the product (how elegant is your code?). 


## Getting set-up

1. Download and install the [R base system](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop IDE](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). Both are needed. Note that installing RStudio will not automatically install R.

2. Set up an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and send your username to the Instructor.


## Course content and schedule

This module is designed 


*Note:* Much of the course material is adapted from the [Data Carpentry for Biologists course](https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/) developed by Ethan White and Zachary Brym.
